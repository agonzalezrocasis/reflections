What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A directory is created (.git) and it is used by Git to keep track of 
all the changes we do in out repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is used as an intermmediate layer between the working directory
and the repository. The working directory is the current state of the repository
and the staging area is used as you can keep track of one or many files in the same
commit, it is important because it is likely that you just want to keep track
of the changes of one specific file and you can achieve this by adding just this 
file to the staging area.
